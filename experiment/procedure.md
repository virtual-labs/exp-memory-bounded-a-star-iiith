### **Step 1: Set Controls**
- In the demo/practice section, set the **start** and **end** vertices.
  - **Start Vertex:** Initial state for the beginning of the algorithm.
  - **End Vertex:** Goal state, heuristics are defined with respect to it.
  - **Memory Limit:** Maximum number of states that can be stored in memory.

### **Step 2: Start the Experiment**
- Click on the  **Start SMA\*** button to begin the experiment.

### **Step 3: Continuing with the Algorithm**
- View the central canvas and changes as you keep clicking the **Next** button. View the **Information** and **Path History** sections for more details.
